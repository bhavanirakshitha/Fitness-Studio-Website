# Fitness-Studio-Website

This project involved developing a Template for a Fitness Studio Website, encompassing both the frontend and backend of the application. Intuitive and user-friendly layouts were designed using Figma, while React was employed for frontend development to ensure a responsive interface. The backend was implemented in Java, with MySQL utilized for managing and storing user data. This experience enhanced skills in full-stack development and strengthened problem-solving abilities and understanding of database management through collaboration on a real-world project.
